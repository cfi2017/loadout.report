# d2-api

d2-api intends to be a low-level Bungie.net api wrapper.

A higher level abstraction is provided by [d2-client]. 
This library is intended to be used by d2-client and other libraries.

* The Destiny Manifest is a special case. It is not a Bungie.net api, but a
  separate api provided by Bungie. It is versioned differently and data retrieved from it can be cached very well.
  The d2-client library provides a higher level abstraction over the manifest API 
  as well as a good default cache implementation.
