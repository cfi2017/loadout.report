**items** | Option<[**Vec<crate::models::DestinyPeriodDefinitionsPeriodMilestonesPeriodDestinyMilestoneQuestRewardItem>**](Destiny.Definitions.Milestones.DestinyMilestoneQuestRewardItem.md)> | The items that represent your reward for completing the quest.  Be warned, these could be \"dummy\" items: items that are only used to render a good-looking in-game tooltip, but aren't the actual items themselves.  For instance, when experience is given there's often a dummy item representing \"experience\", with quantity being the amount of experience you got. We don't have a programmatic association between those and whatever Progression is actually getting that experience... yet. | [optional]
