/// DestinyPeriodDefinitionsPeriodDestinyMedalTierDefinition : An artificial construct of our own creation, to try and put some order on top of Medals and keep them from being one giant, unmanageable and unsorted blob of stats.  Unfortunately, we haven't had time to do this evaluation yet in Destiny 2, so we're short on Medal Tiers. This will hopefully be updated over time, if Medals continue to exist.
