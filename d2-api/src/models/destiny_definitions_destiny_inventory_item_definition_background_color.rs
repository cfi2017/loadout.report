/// DestinyDefinitionsDestinyInventoryItemDefinitionBackgroundColor : Sometimes, an item will have a background color. Most notably this occurs with Emblems, who use the Background Color for small character nameplates such as the \"friends\" view you see in-game. There are almost certainly other items that have background color as well, though I have not bothered to investigate what items have it nor what purposes they serve: use it as you will.
