/// DestinyPeriodDefinitionsPeriodDestinyStatGroupDefinition : When an inventory item (DestinyInventoryItemDefinition) has Stats (such as Attack Power), the item will refer to a Stat Group. This definition enumerates the properties used to transform the item's \"Investment\" stats into \"Display\" stats.  See DestinyStatDefinition's documentation for information about the transformation of Stats, and the meaning of an Investment vs. a Display stat.  If you don't want to do these calculations on your own, fear not: pulling live data from the BNet endpoints will return display stat values pre-computed and ready for you to use. I highly recommend this approach, saves a lot of time and also accounts for certain stat modifiers that can't easily be accounted for without live data (such as stat modifiers on Talent Grids and Socket Plugs)
