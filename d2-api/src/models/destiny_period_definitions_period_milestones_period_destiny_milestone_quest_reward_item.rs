/// DestinyPeriodDefinitionsPeriodMilestonesPeriodDestinyMilestoneQuestRewardItem : A subclass of DestinyItemQuantity, that provides not just the item and its quantity but also information that BNet can - at some point - use internally to provide more robust runtime information about the item's qualities.  If you want it, please ask! We're just out of time to wire it up right now. Or a clever person just may do it with our existing endpoints.
