/// DestinyPeriodDefinitionsPeriodDestinyRaceDefinition : In Destiny, \"Races\" are really more like \"Species\". Sort of. I mean, are the Awoken a separate species from humans? I'm not sure. But either way, they're defined here. You'll see Exo, Awoken, and Human as examples of these Species. Players will choose one for their character.
