/// DestinyPeriodDefinitionsPeriodDestinyActivityModeDefinition : This definition represents an \"Activity Mode\" as it exists in the Historical Stats endpoints. An individual Activity Mode represents a collection of activities that are played in a certain way. For example, Nightfall Strikes are part of a \"Nightfall\" activity mode, and any activities played as the PVP mode \"Clash\" are part of the \"Clash activity mode.  Activity modes are nested under each other in a hierarchy, so that if you ask for - for example - \"AllPvP\", you will get any PVP activities that the user has played, regardless of what specific PVP mode was being played.
