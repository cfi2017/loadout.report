/// DestinyPeriodDefinitionsPeriodDestinyDestinationDefinition : On to one of the more confusing subjects of the API. What is a Destination, and what is the relationship between it, Activities, Locations, and Places?  A \"Destination\" is a specific region/city/area of a larger \"Place\". For instance, a Place might be Earth where a Destination might be Bellevue, Washington. (Please, pick a more interesting destination if you come to visit Earth).
