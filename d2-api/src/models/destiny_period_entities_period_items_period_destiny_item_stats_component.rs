/// DestinyPeriodEntitiesPeriodItemsPeriodDestinyItemStatsComponent : If you want the stats on an item's instanced data, get this component.  These are stats like Attack, Defense etc... and *not* historical stats.  Note that some stats have additional computation in-game at runtime - for instance, Magazine Size - and thus these stats might not be 100% accurate compared to what you see in-game for some stats. I know, it sucks. I hate it too.
