/// DestinyPeriodDestinyActivity : Represents the \"Live\" data that we can obtain about a Character's status with a specific Activity. This will tell you whether the character can participate in the activity, as well as some other basic mutable information.   Meant to be combined with static DestinyActivityDefinition data for a full picture of the Activity.

While other activities could potentially have the same option hashes, for any given D2 base Raid variant the hash will be unique).  As a concrete example of this data, the hashes you get for Raids will correspond to the currently active \"Challenge Mode\".  We don't have any human readable information for these, but saavy 3rd party app users could manually associate the key (a hash identifier for the \"option\" that is enabled/disabled) and the value (whether it's enabled or disabled presently)  On our side, we don't necessarily even know what these are used for (the game designers know, but we don't), and we have no human readable data for them.
