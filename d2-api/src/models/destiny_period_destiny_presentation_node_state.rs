/// DestinyPeriodDestinyPresentationNodeState : I know this doesn't look like a Flags Enumeration/bitmask right now, but I assure you it is. This is the possible states that a Presentation Node can be in, and it is almost certain that its potential states will increase in the future. So don't treat it like a straight up enumeration.
