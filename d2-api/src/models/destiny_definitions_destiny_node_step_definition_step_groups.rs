/// DestinyDefinitionsDestinyNodeStepDefinitionStepGroups : In Destiny 1, the Armory's Perk Filtering was driven by a concept of TalentNodeStepGroups: categorizations of talent nodes based on their functionality. While the Armory isn't a BNet-facing thing for now, and the new Armory will need to account for Sockets rather than Talent Nodes, this categorization capability feels useful enough to still keep around.
